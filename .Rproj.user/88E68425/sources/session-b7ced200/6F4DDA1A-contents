Chaïma BOUGHANMI is a junior data scientist at [BVA xsight](https://www.bva.fr/) in Paris. Data science was the perfectly suited discipline
for her. She is an engineer in statistics and information analysis.
She holds a master's degree in data science from [Université Paris Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/formation/master/mathematiques-et-applications/m2-data-science-sante-assurance-et-finance) and a research master's degree in information processing and complexity of living systems.
Very comfortable with numbers and statistics, she likes to give them meaning and see them have an impact on reality.
She has worked in several fields: energy, sports, polling, FMCG, automotive, telecom, media and marketing.
During her studies, Ms. Boughanmi acquired experience in mathematical modeling, data analysis, programming, data visualization and machine learning.
She also had the opportunity, through her engineering internship, her two end-of-study internships for master's studies and academic projects, to gain an understanding of the data analysis issues in which she was particularly interested, and to build up experience in this field.
Through her studies, Chaïma developed a deep interest in large-scale data analysis and processing, forecasting, optimization, data mining and graph theory.
She loves bringing numbers to life, giving them meaning and value.
She has a very good mastery of programming languages, especially
R and R/shiny. She was a member of [R-Ladies Tunis](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-tunis/) when she was a student and is currently one of the organizers of [R-Ladies Paris](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/rladies-paris/).
She also masters Python, SQL, SAS and, not surprisingly, Latex and Git.
Miss Boughanmi is a footballer, so when she's not playing with numbers and data, she's playing with the ball ! That's why she chose to work on tactical analysis of team sports during her Master's research.
With the Paris Saclay team, Chaïma and her teammates qualified for the 2022 france championship, finishing first in île de France and 5th in all of France.
