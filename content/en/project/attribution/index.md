ChannelAttribution, an R library, builds the Markov models that allow us to calculate the number of conversions and/or conversion value that can be attributed to each marketing channel. In other words, ChannelAttribution uses Markov models to determine each channel's contribution to conversion and/or value. I implemented this an attribution model using this package and I applied it to a set of data.
