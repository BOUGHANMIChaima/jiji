PyStan uses the MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) method to estimate Bayesian models using the STAN language.
This code contains the steps to make a MULTIPLICATIVE Marketing Mix Model by estimating the adstock and diminishing return parameters and specifying the priors. 
My script also contains a breakdown of the contribution of the various marketing channels.
More details in my Github.
