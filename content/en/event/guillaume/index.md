summary: In recent years, the pharmaceutical industry has undergone two major paradigm shifts, both of which have transformed the drug development and collaboration environment. The first paradigm shift revolves around the implementation of precision medicine. The second paradigm shift is around the adoption of programming languages, particularly the rise of R alongside traditional tools such as SAS. In 2022, we weren't in a position to answer these questions, but things have changed radically in 2023.
