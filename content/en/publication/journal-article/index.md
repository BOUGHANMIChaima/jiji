abstract: The World Health Organization estimates that 12 million people die from heart disease every year worldwide, and that half of all deaths in the United States and other developed countries are due to cardiovascular disease. So this research aims to identiﬁer global risk factors and create a model that attempts to predict whether or not a patient has this disease.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
