abstract: In a world of constant change, mobility has become an inescapable component of the global talent management strategy deployed by multinational organizations. We reﬂlect on the taste of life, particularly when we consider moving from one place to another, and our perspective on the subject is often rather narrow. The aim of this project is to understand what exactly is the cost of living and how it relates to other indices.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: A simple linear regression performed on a database taken from a study by Mercer in 2017.
